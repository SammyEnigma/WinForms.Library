This is a collection of helpers and data binding utillities for WinForms development. Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/adamosoftware/WinForms.Library/wiki) for latest info.

There's also a separate Nuget package **AO.FileSystem** that removes the WinForms dependency, and has [FileSystem.EnumFiles](https://github.com/adamosoftware/WinForms.Library/blob/master/WinForms.Library/FileSystem_DotNetSearch.cs#L26) and [FileSystem.FindFilesAsync](https://github.com/adamosoftware/WinForms.Library/blob/master/WinForms.Library/FileSystem_DotNetSearch.cs#L67) methods.
